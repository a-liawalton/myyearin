                        <p>Besides the fact that Zazie Beetz totally jacked my go-to hairstyle, I enjoyed her performance; the strategically-placed <i>9 to 5</i> song by Dolly Parton; and the silly cameos of other actors I've enjoyed in the past.</p>

                        <p>12 years in the making, the follow-up to the childhood movie was a smashing success. The villian was carefully crafted and stylish to boot. And side note: I loved the short film <i>Bao</i> that played before the movie.</p>

                        <p>Teen romance flicks are a personal weakness, and Netflix has come through clutch with multiple options. This was one of my favorites from this year.</p>

                        <p>I didn't expect to see this film, much less genuinely enjoy it. Thankfully, my boyfriend dragged me to the theatre to experience the ride of my life. </p>

                    <div class="overlay">
                        <p>Although I feel ashamed to say that I didn't watch any of the predecessor films, I enjoyed the storytelling - I'm a killer for a spy-esque film - and the costume design. Cate Blanchett probably wins costume design of the year.</p>

                        <p>I grew up watching Halloween and was grateful that I got to see this timeline-bending sequel at the Cinerama. More of a nostalgia-pleaser than anything else, Halloween still makes my list for the year.</p>

                        <p>Not an Amy Schumer fan by any means, I am a sucker for a good makeover movie. This was a clever take, touting the message that the greatest makeover is the one on our sense of confidence. (Other issues exist with the movie, but this central theme spoke to me.)</p>

                        <p>I'd wondered why Sanaa Lathan had gone bald and didn't think anything of it. Netflix gains even more of my respect by showing an experience shared by many Black women - the Big Chop and the self-love journey that follows.</p>
